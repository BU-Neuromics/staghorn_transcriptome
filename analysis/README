The primary result files of this analysis are as follows:

- *Holobiont_transcripts.fa*: concatenated assembled transcriptome sequences from
  both sites in FASTA format
- *Holobiont_cdhit.fa.clstr*: cdhit clusters of Holobiont_transcripts.fa
- *Holobiont_transcripts_blast_annot.csv*: best hit blast annotations for each
  sequence in Holobiont_transcripts.fa, fields:

  * SeqID - `Acer__XX...` name of assembled transcript
  * ClusterID - transcript name of the representative sequence that was
    clustered with SeqID
  * HoloID - ID composed of protein accessions of top blast hits from either or
    both of CNI and SYM, if a single accession the sequence only mapped to one
    organism, if in <CNI>-<SYM> format, the sequence blasted against Cnidaria
    accession <CNI> and Symbiodinium accession <SYM>
  * Sbj_ID_cni - accession of hit against Cnidaria
  * Sbj_title_cni - protein name of hit against Cnidaria
  * Sbj_start_cni - starting alignment position of sequence against accession
  * Sbj_end_cni - starting alignment position of sequence against accession
  * Sbj_ID_smb - accession of hit against Symbiodinium
  * Sbj_title_smb - protein name of hit against Symbiodinium
  * Sbj_start_smb - starting alignment position of sequence against accession
  * Sbj_end_smb - starting alignment position of sequence against accession
  * seq - the transcript sequence

- *Holobiont_transcripts_other.fa*: transcripts that had blast hits for neither
  Cnidaria nor Symbiodinium

There is a set of files for each of Cnidaria and Symbiodinium, as follows:

- *Holobiont_transcripts_cni.fa*: subset of Holobiont_transcripts.fa that blast
  against something from Cnidaria
- *Holobiont_transcripts_cni.gtf*: GTF annotation of Holobiont_transcripts.fa
  that blast against something from Cnidaria
- *all_salmon_quant_cni.csv*: salmon quantification of all eight FASTQ samples
  against a salmon index built with the Cnidaria transcripts, consolidated to
  the protein level
- *filt_salmon_quant_cni.csv*: filtered counts, such that only proteins with
  all non-zero counts in either site are included
- *de_site_cni.csv*: deseq2 differential expression results comparing samples
  from different sites (i.e. 4x4)
